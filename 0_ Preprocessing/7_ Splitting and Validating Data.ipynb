    "\n",
    "- **Train Data:** Train data is the data that we use to train our machine learning model. This data consists of input features and their corresponding output labels. The model learns patterns from this data and uses them to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "- **Validation Data:** Validation data is the data that we use to evaluate the performance of our model during training. We use this data to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The validation data should be representative of the unseen data that the model will encounter in the real world.\n",
    "- **Test Data:** Test data is the data that we use to evaluate the final performance of our model after training and tuning. This data should be completely separate from the train and validation data to avoid any data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common issue when training a model is **overfitting**. This phenomenon occurs when a model performs really well on the data that we used to train it but it fails to generalize well to new, unseen data points. There are numerous reasons why this can happen — it could be due to the noise in data or it could be that the model learned to predict specific inputs rather than the predictive parameters that could help it make correct predictions. Typically, the higher the complexity of a model the higher the chance that it will be overfitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **underfitting** occurs when the model has poor performance even on the data that was used to train it. In most cases, underfitting occurs because the model is not suitable for the problem you are trying to solve. Usually, this means that the model is less complex than required in order to learn those parameters that can be proven to be predictive."
